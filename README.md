## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Shrikara B Varna**. I'm a graduate student from **Carnegie Mellon University**, pursuing my Masters in Intelligent Information Systems (ML and NLP) from the LTI department of SCS. My main interest lies in Machine Learning/Deep Learning and NLP. Have worked on various ML models while learning to get hands-on experience. My current research is in the field of Multimodal ML and am working on creating a video summarizer.


* I'm currently learning best practices and the theory behind the models of ML.
* Interested in the implementation of new research papers
*  ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects involving **NLP** and develop applications for low-resource languages.
* I'm looking to collaborate on any project involving ML model building, training, and testing.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the math behind Generative Models and their Robustness and trying my hands on various QA systems.
* Current projects in development: Multimodal (Video) Summarizer, Visual CommonSense Reasoning, and LLMs for Math
